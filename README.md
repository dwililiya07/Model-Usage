# Model-Usage
*Image Classification and Transfer Learning*

This project is my task in Mastering AI Bootcamp. This project talk about model usage. The tasks have two parts. 
The first part is to create an image classification project that predicts a person's age based on their photograph. I use age classifier pipeline from hugging face and create UI using gradio. The model is nateraw/vit-age-classifier.
The last part is to build the model for emotion recognition using transfer learning method. I used Vision Transformer (VIT) model pre-trained on ImageNet-21k and fine tune it on the FastJobs/Visual_Emotional_Analysis dataset, with the final step being the publication of my trained model to the Hugging Face Model Hub.
